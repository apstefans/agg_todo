# Aggressive ToDo list

## Current functionality

Add a task -- 1 / Done

Delete a task -- 2 / Done

View full list -- 3 / Done

Quit Program -- q / Done

- Run continuously until quit / Done

## Ideas to build upon

     - View first 5 items at start. If more than 5 items, allow show full task list
     - Allow completed tasks without deleting them. View them in a sepearte Completed tasks list
     - Allow making "Folders" with tasks lists, for example, work, home, hobby.
     - Print time a task was created and completed
     - Set deadline
     - If task overdue, make different color
     - Sepereate list for overdue tasks
